# rock-paper-scissors

I created this rock paper scissors game as a project according to The Odin's Project curriculum.
I first made it a game to play in the console. And next, I added an UI to this game. I decided to imitate
those games with fake advertisements in which the actual content is different from what is
advertised. In the loader, I gave a brief introduction to Break The Game, but the actual game
is rock paper scissors.
